This is where I am going to put all of my games. (To access zombie slayer you need to install CMU graphics and python, access cmu here --> https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop)
All of my games are open source and therefore if you want you can tweak them and make them better. You could also give me recommendations and I will go in and add them.
